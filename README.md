### The Inbox Page
After signing in with GitHub users will be greeted by their inbox, a page that shows all users that have sent them a message. Included on this page is the users country flag, profile picture, and username as well as a logout and send drawing button. One of our favorite features on this page is the ability to draw your own profile picture! To do this, click on your profile picture and use the drawing application to complete your portrait.

### The Gallery Page
After clicking on a user in your inbox page, you will be brought to the gallery page. This view shows all messages recieved from that user, as well as their country flag, profile picture, and username. From this page, you can view drawings or click the send arrow to send the current user a drawing.

### The Drawing Page
The drawing application features 9 colors and a size slider. Simply choose a color, brush size and begin drawing! Once the first brush stroke is made, a 20s timer will start. When the timer ends, the drawing will be sent.
